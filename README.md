Functions in the Babylon.js Scene
This project uses Babylon.js to create an interactive 3D scene. Below is a detailed description of the various functions implemented within the scene:

Video
Description: Shows or hides a video plane within the 3D scene. The video can be interacted with to play or pause it by clicking directly on the video plane. This is useful for embedding multimedia content within the scene.
Fire Sphere
Description: Displays or hides a sphere with a dynamic fire texture. This adds a visually striking element to the scene, useful for demonstrating procedural textures and enhancing visual effects.
Heightmap
Description: Toggles the visibility of a ground mesh generated from a height map and a corresponding image. This feature is ideal for demonstrating terrain modeling and height map visualizations.
TUD Logo
Description: Shows or hides a 3D model of the TUD logo, which rotates continuously. This is particularly useful for displaying branding elements or highlighting logos within the scene.
Magenta Spotlight
Description: Enables or disables a magenta spotlight, illuminating the scene with a distinct magenta hue. This function is great for creating dramatic lighting effects and showcasing different lighting techniques.
Skybox
Description: Toggles the visibility of the skybox, a large cube that surrounds the scene with a texture simulating the sky. This adds a realistic backdrop to the scene, enhancing the overall visual experience.
XR Experience
Description: Initializes the XR (Extended Reality) experience. Depending on the selected mode (AR or VR), this feature configures the scene for augmented reality or virtual reality interactions, including hand tracking and movement capabilities. This provides an immersive experience for users with compatible devices.
